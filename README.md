See: [http://ns.science.ai](http://ns.science.ai).

The 'Scholarly Article Ontology' (<abbr title="Scholarly Article
Ontology">SA</abbr>) is a set of terms (formally defined in
[RDF Schema](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)) necessary to describe
the production process, content, distribution and preservation of
scholarly articles (and similar artifacts).


The 'Scholarly Article Ontology' (<abbr title="Scholarly Article
Ontology">SA</abbr>) is **aimed to be used along with
[schema.org](http://schema.org)** and in particular, the
[ScholarlyArticle](http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle) class (and
subclasses). When possible, <abbr title="Scholarly Article
Ontology">SA</abbr> terms of broad interest will be proposed to
schema.org and removed from this ontology if accepted.
